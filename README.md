## Refactoring

### In this project I am refactoring a starter code, so that its web accessibility is smoother by making the following changes:

* Consolidating the CSS
* Changing class names in the html 
* Changing the HTML to include semantics
* Adding “alt” attributes to the images and icons 
* Making sure the links work properly 

## Deployed Website

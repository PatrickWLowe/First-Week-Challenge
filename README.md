# First-Week-Challenge

## Code Refactoring

### In this project I am refactoring a starter code, so that its web accessibility is smoother by making the following changes:

* Consolidating and reorganized the CSS
* Changing class names in the html that were redundant
* Changing the HTML elements to include semantics HTML elements
* Adding “alt” attributes to the images and icons 
* Making sure the links work properly 
* Updated the title of the page
